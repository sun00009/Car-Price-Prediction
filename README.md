# Car-Price-Prediction

With the rise in the variety of cars with differentiated capabilities and features such as model, production year, category, brand, fuel type, engine volume, mileage, cylinders, colour, airbags and many more, we are bringing a car price prediction challenge for all. We all aspire to own a car within budget with the best features available. To solve the price problem we have created a dataset of 19237 for the training dataset and 8245 for the test dataset.<br />
